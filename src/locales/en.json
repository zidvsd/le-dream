The service is above and beyond, the food is great and open later into the night than any other hotel which can be convenient for late nights. They can even serve breakfast through room service free of charge. The beds are very comfortable and the AC works really well. No complaints about this hotel, only good things can be said all around. Food & Drinks: We tried a lot of different food on the menu and all of it tasted fresh and amazing.",
